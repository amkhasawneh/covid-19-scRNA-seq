Made a new file (20220727-COVID-19-manuscript.docx) for the manuscript.
TCR data is not included in this file!
Looked up some more references about IGHV genes of interest.
Found this very important part in Jin et al:

Statistical analysis
Fisher’s exact test was used to assess differences in usage of V and J gene segments and the proportion of Ig isotypes between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test was used to analyze differences in clonal diversity, CDR3 length and SHM rate among different groups. The significance thresholds were P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were implemented with R software (Version 3.5.1).


Tasks:
Apply the same statistical procedures to our data. They make a lot of sense!
•	Fisher’s exact test for V–J usage between the three groups (healthy, deceased, recovered).
•	Fisher’s exact test for Ig isotypes between the three groups.
•	Wilcoxon’s test for clonal diversity.

Continue on with the report, including differential gene expression analysis results.

Wilcoxon’s test, applied to diversity scores of V gene usage in the individual samples, gave the following results:
•	We can conclude that there is no difference between recovered and dead patients,
•	Healthy controls have significantly higher diversity, in both Inverse Simpson, and Shannon indexes.
•	Doing the same comparison with V–J combinations, or J genes alone, yields less insight (no significant differences).


I have also remade the BCR V–J heatmaps, removing the parts with the complete.cases() function.

I have written some stuff in the manuscript skeleton:
•	Added citations for other studies that found similar IGHV genes.
•	Added information about IGHV1-18, and found interesting findings about it in other papers.

Tasks:
•	Fisher’s exact test for V–J usage between the three groups (healthy, deceased, recovered), as well as the healthy group vs. the others.
•	Fisher’s exact test for Ig isotypes between the three groups, and healthy vs. not-so.
Continue writing: include more about IGHV1-18; include diversity information; maybe Fisher’s test results too.

I have written some stuff in the manuscript skeleton:
•	Added a reference for an interesting study about IGHV4-34.
•	Added information about IGHV1-18 as a biomarker in melanoma.
•	Added some information about the isotypes in the data.

Performed isotype diversity analysis, with the results showing an opposite trend to that observed with v gene usage; added this to the PowePoint file containing V gene usage diversity results.

Extracted the CDR1, 2, and 3 amino acid sequences for the clonotypes, in order of abundance, so that we can synthesize antibodies!

Tasks:
•	Continue writing about isotypes in the manuscript; include information about preferential usage, with p values and all!
•	Consult again with Tabe Sensei about heatmaps vs. bar graphs.
•	Read more papers about BCR analysis; maybe one from the pile under my diary.

9 o’clock meeting tasks:
•	Compare clonotype sequences. And check for similarities with Cao et al.
•	Does FindAllMarkers do ANOVA?
•	Make a table for up and down regulated genes and pathways for each patient between samples. 
•	Compare diversity between severity stages of each patient. Match them with lines on the graph. Separate it by severity, and remember sequence.
•	Write more in the manuscript.
The “done ones”:
•	Make a table for up and down regulated genes and pathways for each patient between samples. 
•	Does FindAllMarkers do ANOVA? No! It is not what we want, so for the table above I had to subset into two samples only at a time for patients 5 and 6.

Things I done did today:
•	Improved the code to extract the cdr 1 and 2 (and 3) for heavy (and light) chains. Hopefully, the new code is more accurate, as it takes into account the cell barcode too. Now I need to count the most abundant AA sequences.
•	Wrote some! Added a “statistical analysis” part in the methods section, and added a paragraph about V gene diversity in the results.
•	Adjusted the DEGs and pathways to 10 and 20, respectively.

What I did today?
•	Finished redoing the up/down gene/pathway table, and uploaded it to Box.
•	Added paragraph about isotype diversity in manuscript.
•	Added code for isotype contingency table.

What I did today:
•	Changed V–J gene usage bar graphs to “stacked”, and changed the colors to a more contrasting combination, and added those to the manuscript.
•	Added paragraph on J gene usage in manuscript, and started dividing Results and Discussion.

What I did today:
•	Added some information in the manuscript about the most common V genes.
•	Added some code about clonal expansion in critical/severe vs. mild/moderate cases, and corresponding information in manuscript.
•	Wrote some discussion about V gene usage.

To-dos:
•	Continue writing, somehow adding DGE analysis in the mix.

Done ones:
•	Adjusted the cdr3 list, to include only the interesting V genes, the top ones from each sample, etc.
•	Adjusted figure 1 and s1; removed the “comprehensive” UMAPs.


To-dos:
•	What exactly is cdr3? How is it different from what we’ve done so far?
•	Remove heatmap for all in figure 2.
•	Change bar graphs to percentage (y-axis).
•	Refer to PowerPoint file from Tabe Sensei!

Done ones:
•	Adjusted the cdr3 list, to also include the V, D, and J genes from both chains.
•	What exactly is cdr3? How is it different from what we’ve done so far?
It is the junctional site of V(D)J recombination. Cells with identical CDR3s are considered of the same clone.
•	Removed heatmaps for all in Figure 2 and S2.
•	Changed bar graphs to percentage (y-axis), finally! This is the best way to do it:
… +
geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +  …
•	Made B cell distribution table, as requested by Tabe Sensei.
•	Made B cell distribution bar plots, using the scripts from Jessica.
To-dos:
•	Refer to PowerPoint file from Tabe Sensei!

Done ones:
•	Performed the tasks requested by Scientific Reports for Takahashi’s antibody manuscript. This took all day, and the most challenging part was editing the PDF for author consent to change author list.

Done ones:
•	Redid the bar plots, with a new color palette, and matching UMAPs; added all to PowerPoint file from Sensei; removed legends from all plots except the controls’ bar plot, which I made large. 
•	Remembered to commit figures.r file, which already was part of the repository.
•	Proofread Takahashi’s antibody manuscript. Hopefully it’s now ready for resubmission, pending the author list change consent form.
•	Added IGHV abundance table in Tabe Sensei’s PowerPoint file.
Tasks:
•	Make heatmaps that look like Jessica’s (I think; need Sensei’s confirmation).
•	DGE and GSEA (and maybe pathway) analysis and plots to go with it.

Done things:
•	Make heatmaps that look like Jessica’s? No. 
•	Started GSEA analysis using Hot Tommy’s tutorial online.
•	Signed the author list form from Scientific Reports, and sent it to Sensei.

Tasks:
•	Make sure the bar plot percentages for V gene usage are for each sample.
•	Continue GSEA and DGE analysis.

Done things:
•	Submitted Tahakashi’s manuscript and sent the changed authorship form.
•	Made the bar plot percentages for V gene usage separate for each sample, using this for the aes inside the geom_bar() function:

aes(y = (..count..)/tapply(..count..,..PANEL..,sum)[..PANEL..])
•	Inserted the above bar plots into the “manuscript”.
•	Started GSEA analysis, but the fgsea function only gives results and graphs for Patient 1, Patient 2 (none significant), and Patient 5 (only moderate).

Tasks:
•	Adjust GSEA analysis code, making sure to analyze each of the 3 samples in patients 5 and 6 against only one other at a time.
•	Start writing results of the above analysis, and make graphs, and send them to Sensei by the end of the week.
