Made a new file (20220727-COVID-19-manuscript.docx) for the manuscript.
TCR data is not included in this file!
Looked up some more references about IGHV genes of interest.
Found this very important part in Jin et al:

Statistical analysis
Fisher’s exact test was used to assess differences in usage of V and J gene segments and the proportion of Ig isotypes between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test was used to analyze differences in clonal diversity, CDR3 length and SHM rate among different groups. The significance thresholds were P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were implemented with R software (Version 3.5.1).


Tasks:
Apply the same statistical procedures to our data. They make a lot of sense!
•	Fisher’s exact test for V–J usage between the three groups (healthy, deceased, recovered).
•	Fisher’s exact test for Ig isotypes between the three groups.
•	Wilcoxon’s test for clonal diversity.

Continue on with the report, including differential gene expression analysis results.

Wilcoxon’s test, applied to diversity scores of V gene usage in the individual samples, gave the following results:
•	We can conclude that there is no difference between recovered and dead patients,
•	Healthy controls have significantly higher diversity, in both Inverse Simpson, and Shannon indexes.
•	Doing the same comparison with V–J combinations, or J genes alone, yields less insight (no significant differences).


I have also remade the BCR V–J heatmaps, removing the parts with the complete.cases() function.

I have written some stuff in the manuscript skeleton:
•	Added citations for other studies that found similar IGHV genes.
•	Added information about IGHV1-18, and found interesting findings about it in other papers.

Tasks:
•	Fisher’s exact test for V–J usage between the three groups (healthy, deceased, recovered), as well as the healthy group vs. the others.
•	Fisher’s exact test for Ig isotypes between the three groups, and healthy vs. not-so.
Continue writing: include more about IGHV1-18; include diversity information; maybe Fisher’s test results too.

I have written some stuff in the manuscript skeleton:
•	Added a reference for an interesting study about IGHV4-34.
•	Added information about IGHV1-18 as a biomarker in melanoma.
•	Added some information about the isotypes in the data.

Performed isotype diversity analysis, with the results showing an opposite trend to that observed with v gene usage; added this to the PowePoint file containing V gene usage diversity results.

Extracted the CDR1, 2, and 3 amino acid sequences for the clonotypes, in order of abundance, so that we can synthesize antibodies!

Tasks:
•	Continue writing about isotypes in the manuscript; include information about preferential usage, with p values and all!
•	Consult again with Tabe Sensei about heatmaps vs. bar graphs.
•	Read more papers about BCR analysis; maybe one from the pile under my diary.

9 o’clock meeting tasks:
•	Compare clonotype sequences. And check for similarities with Cao et al.
•	Does FindAllMarkers do ANOVA?
•	Make a table for up and down regulated genes and pathways for each patient between samples. 
•	Compare diversity between severity stages of each patient. Match them with lines on the graph. Separate it by severity, and remember sequence.
•	Write more in the manuscript.
The “done ones”:
•	Make a table for up and down regulated genes and pathways for each patient between samples. 
•	Does FindAllMarkers do ANOVA? No! It is not what we want, so for the table above I had to subset into two samples only at a time for patients 5 and 6.

Things I done did today:
•	Improved the code to extract the cdr 1 and 2 (and 3) for heavy (and light) chains. Hopefully, the new code is more accurate, as it takes into account the cell barcode too. Now I need to count the most abundant AA sequences.
•	Wrote some! Added a “statistical analysis” part in the methods section, and added a paragraph about V gene diversity in the results.
•	Adjusted the DEGs and pathways to 10 and 20, respectively.

What I did today?
•	Finished redoing the up/down gene/pathway table, and uploaded it to Box.
•	Added paragraph about isotype diversity in manuscript.
•	Added code for isotype contingency table.
