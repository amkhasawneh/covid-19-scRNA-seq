Made a new file (20220727-COVID-19-manuscript.docx) for the manuscript.
TCR data is not included in this file!
Looked up some more references about IGHV genes of interest.
Found this very important part in Jin et al:

Statistical analysis
Fisher’s exact test was used to assess differences in usage of V and J gene segments and the proportion of Ig isotypes between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test was used to analyze differences in clonal diversity, CDR3 length and SHM rate among different groups. The significance thresholds were P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were implemented with R software (Version 3.5.1).


Tasks:
Apply the same statistical procedures to our data. They make a lot of sense!
•	Fisher’s exact test for V–J usage between the three groups (healthy, deceased, recovered).
•	Fisher’s exact test for Ig isotypes between the three groups.
•	Wilcoxon’s test for clonal diversity.

Continue on with the report, including differential gene expression analysis results.

Wilcoxon’s test, applied to diversity scores of V gene usage in the individual samples, gave the following results:
•	We can conclude that there is no difference between recovered and dead patients,
•	Healthy controls have significantly higher diversity, in both Inverse Simpson, and Shannon indexes.
•	Doing the same comparison with V–J combinations, or J genes alone, yields less insight (no significant differences).


I have also remade the BCR V–J heatmaps, removing the part with the complete.cases() function.

I have written some stuff in the manuscript skeleton:
•	Added citations for other studies that found similar IGHV genes.
•	Added information about IGHV1-18, and found interesting findings about it in other papers.

Tasks:
•	Fisher’s exact test for V–J usage between the three groups (healthy, deceased, recovered), as well as the healthy group vs. the others.
•	Fisher’s exact test for Ig isotypes between the three groups, and healthy vs. not-so.
•	Continue writing: include more about IGHV1-18; include diversity information; maybe Fisher’s test results too.
