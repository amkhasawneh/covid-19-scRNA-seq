Introduction
Upon stimulation, B cells switch from naïve B cells with IgM or IgD antibodies/receptors to (eventually) antibody-producing plasma cells secreting IgA, IgG, or IgE. Whereas a BCR’s affinity for an antigen is improved through somatic hypermutation in the variable region (mostly in the V and J genes), this process of changing Ig type, termed class switching, is achieved through recombination in the heavy-chain constant region, and improves a receptor’s effector functions.[1, 2]


Materials and Methods
Sample collection
A total of 17 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analysed: 14 samples were collected from 6 COVID-19 inpatients admitted into Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, at several points in time with different stages of disease progression (see Table S1 for patient information); and 3 samples were collected from 3 healthy donors. The median age for patients was 76 years (range: 53-93), and all but Patient 1 were male.
SARS-CoV-2 infection was established through RT-PCR-based molecular testing, and was performed using nasopharyngeal specimens by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).[3] Disease severity was determined based on the WHO criteria.[4] Clinical background data was obtained by accessing the patients’ records at the hospital.

Sample processing 
PBMCs were isolated using BD Vacutainer CPT tubes according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The collected cells were suspended in 1 mL of CELLBANKER 1 plus (Nihon Zenyaku Kogyo, Koriyama, Japan), frozen at -80°C, and then used for flow cytometry analysis and 10x single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Serum samples were stored at -80°C prior to use.

Single cell RNA-seq assay (10x platform) 
PBMC suspensions were barcoded through the 10x Chromium Single Cell platform using Chromium Next GEM single cell 5’ GEM reagent kits v2 (PN-1000263, 10x Genomics, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The loaded cells numbered approximately 1.6 × 104, aiming for 1.0 × 104 single cells per reaction on the Chip K Single Cell Kit (PN-1000286, 10x Genomics) with the Chromium controller (10x Genomics). Single-cell RNA libraries were prepared, and unique sample indexes added using the library construction kit, the Single Index Kit T Set A (PN-1000213, 10x Genomics), and a universal library conversion kit (App-A, cat. No. 1000004155, MGI, China). The libraries were sequenced using the DNBSEQ-G400 platform (MGI).

Data processing
Raw sequencing reads in FASTQ format were analyzed using the Cell Ranger (10x Genomics, version 6.1.2) multi pipeline, performing gene expression (GEX) alignment against the GRCh38 human reference dataset (10x Genomics) with a SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (GenBank: LC606022.1) appended. V(D)J assembly and alignment and paired clonotype calling for T and B cell receptors were done against the refdata-cellranger-vdj-GRCh38-alts-ensembl-5.0.0 reference (10x Genomics). CDR3 sequences and rearranged full-length BCR/TCR V(D)J segments as well as clonotype frequency were also obtained.

Single-cell RNA-seq
Downstream single-cell data analysis of Cell Ranger’s output expression count matrices was performed using the R programming language (version 4.2.1)[5] with the Seurat package (version 4.0).[6]	All samples were integrated into one dataset, categorized according to severity and patient identity. Cell cycle phases were determined for each cell, which were confirmed to have no discernible effect on the variation of the data. Upon evaluation of the quality of the gene counts, the collective sample was restricted to cells associated with more than 500 transcripts, more than 250 genes, and less than 20% mitochondrial genes. Genes with zero counts were also removed from the dataset. After this filtration, 139,987 cells were kept for further analysis. 
The data were normalized, and variable features determined for clustering the cells. The Azimuth web application was used for cluster annotation,[6] and UMAP dimensionality reduction was used to view the resulting cell clusters/types. Azimuth annotations were used as cell type identifiers in further analysis.

Immune repertoire analysis
Gene expression data matrices from the scRNA-seq analysis were subset to two groups: T cells (CD3-enriched cells), and B cells. To these were integrated the clonotype filtered contig data for each library in the scRepertoire R package (version 1.7.0)[7] using the CombineTCR and CombineBCR functions. Only productive TCR/BCR sequences were kept for subsequent analysis. TCR/BCR repertoire analysis was performed using the Seurat and scRepertoire packages in R. 

Statistical analysis
The Shannon index was used to calculate the V gene usage and Ig isotype diversity scores for the individual samples[8], and Wilcoxon’s test was used to compare the clonal and isotype diversity indices between samples, to compare isotype proportions, and to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different subsets of the data.[9] In all statistical comparisons, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the R programming language.[5]

Results
Thirty cell clusters were identified by the Azimuth application across 139,987 cells. Of these, 30,071 (21.5%) were from the samples of the healthy donors, 15,493 (11.1%) were from the COVID-19 patients’ samples in mild stage, 32,182 (23%) in moderate stage, 10518 (7.5%) in severe stage, and 51,723 (36.9%) in critical stage (Figure 1).
Upon examining the proportions of the different cell types among the severity groups, some interesting patterns emerged. CD4TCM ??? , but CD8 TEM cell numbers were inversely proportional to severity in all cases except Patient 2, but plasmablast numbers were in direct proportion to severity except in Patient 5. In Patient 4, a sharp increase in CD4 TCM and plasmablasts was observed with increased severity, accompanied by a decrease in CD8 TEM. Patient 6, who improved over the course of sample collection (from critical to severe to moderate), had a decrease in CD4 TCM, and an increase in CD8 TEM. Of note, in Patient 5, CD4 TCM cells and plasmablasts witnessed a sharp decrease between critical and severe states, but had an increase upon progressing into the moderate state.

BCR
After V(D)J sequence integration into the scRNA-seq data, we obtained 6955 cells classified as B cells: B intermediate (21.6%), B naïve (35.5%), B memory (9.6%), and Plasmablasts (33.3%).
	Our data show that BCR V gene usage diversity was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p value = 0.0029). Comparing COVID-19 patients with different outcomes, however, no significant differences in V gene diversity were discerned between deceased and recovered patients. The proportion of expanded clones (3 cells or more) was significantly higher in critical/severe cases than in mild/moderate ones (p =0.008).
The most abundant V–J gene usage combination was IGHV3-23–IGHJ4, which was observed in all samples regardless of disease status and severity. The second highest frequency was with IGHV4-34–IGHJ5, mostly detected in the deceased Patient 2’s critical sample (Figure 2). Of particular interest was the IGH1-18 gene, observed most commonly with IGHJ3 in the deceased Patient 1 in the critical (and terminal) stage. Also of interest was IGHV4-39, most highly used in Patient 3’s (deceased) critical sample. This gene has also been used for CLL prognostication, and as a marker for progression into Richter Syndrome.[10]
J gene usage analysis revealed preferential usage of the IGHJ4 gene for all samples, except for Patient 2, whose critical sample showed a predominance of IGHJ5 usage. No significant difference was observed in J gene usage diversity across the samples.
Concerning isotype diversity, we observed more diverse isotypes in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p = 0.0059), which is the opposite direction to V gene usage diversity. No significant difference in isotype diversity was found between deceased and recovered patients. In our collective data set, the most common isotype was IgM; it was also the most common Ig type in the individual samples except those of Patient 2 and Patient 3—both deceased. Patient 2 had larger proportions of IgA1, IgA2, and IgG1; and Patient 3 had IgA1 in the largest proportions. The use of IgA1 was significantly higher in the deceased than in the recovered patients (p = 0.0013) and healthy controls (p = 0.024).


Differential Gene Expression in B Cells
Based on the IGHV gene biases observed in our samples, we subset the data and sought differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways to find possible associations between certain immune repertoires and transcriptomic profiles for the different samples. Due to the low number of B cells thus obtained, these comparisons were limited. With the exception of Patient 1, no significantly enriched pathways were found between the severity groups within each patient. Even in Patient 1 (subset to cells with the IGHV1-18 gene), Interferon Alpha Response and Interferon Gamma Response were the only pathways significantly enriched in the moderate compared to the critical stage. While the same two pathways were enriched in Patients 2 and 6 in the moderate stage, Patient 3 (deceased) showed non-significant enrichment of these two pathways in the critical stage. This sub-setting also yielded no significantly expressed differential genes between the severity stages in Patient 5.

Pathway Enrichment in B Cells
Comparing pathway enrichment between deceased and surviving patients showed significant differences in the moderate and critical stages. In the moderate stage, deceased patients showed more enrichment of the Interferon Alpha/Gamma Response pathways compared to the surviving patients, except when comparing Patient 2 to Patient 4, where Interferon Alpha was not significantly differentially enriched. This is in line with the observed significant differences in IgA1 proportions between the two groups, as Interferon Alpha stimulates Ig class-switching,[11]. This pathway also induces B cell maturation into plasmablasts,[12] whose proportions are higher in the deceased cohort. The Interferon Alpha pathway has also been reported to play a role in stimulating clonal expansion and cell differentiation.[12] Interferon Gamma also regulates class switching and Ig secretion.[13, 14] Comparing the deteriorating patients (moderate to critical) to the improving ones yields similar gene set enrichment profiles in the moderate stage to the ones above, suggesting an upregulation trend in the deteriorating patients in inflammatory and Interferon pathways.
Among the pathways enriched in the improving patients in the moderate stage, TNFA signalling via NFKB was of note, as downregulation of this signalling pathway has been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases.[15, 16] This suggests that this might be a prognostic factor whose downregulation predicts patient deterioration. Also upregulated in improving moderate-stage patients was the MYC Targets V1 pathway. This pathway is thought to promote cell proliferation through involvement in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation.[17, 18] Enrichment of this pathway in the recovering patients might be indicative of tissue repair after inflammation.
In the critical stage, the TNFA signalling pathway was also downregulated in the deceased patients 2 and 3, further supporting the idea that this pathway is indicative of a recovering immune system. Oxidative phosphorylation was enriched in Patients 2 and 3 in the critical stage compared to recovered patients. This process is important in innate immunity and T cell proliferation.[19, 20] Dysfunction in this pathway is thought to be associated with excessive release of reactive oxygen species and other inflammatory cytokines and enzymes involved in promoting hyperinflammation in sepsis, and might increase viral replication in diseased cells.[21] It is also believed that, through manipulating the metabolic and signalling functions of mitochondria, SARS-CoV proteins can evade the immune system and alter the host’s anti-viral response.[22] It is possible that this kind of viral “hijacking” of the mitochondria is responsible for the high enrichment of this pathway.
The mTORC1 pathway was enriched in Patients 2 and 3 in the critical stage, as well, which is involved in regulating important immunological processes such as proliferation, metabolism, programmed cell death, and autophagy. It is also known to be sensitive to the immunosuppressant rapamycin, which has been suggested as a repurposed COVID-19 drug that regulates the abovementioned processes and inhibits cytokines. [23-26] At the same time, p53 was downregulated in these two deceased patients. Tumor protein p53 (coded by the gene TP53) is a tumor suppressor that plays a role in controlling cell division and safeguarding the genome from mutations.[27] Similar to other viruses, it is believed that the SARS-CoV viruses have developed mechanisms to degrade p53 and exploit the pathway to further virus replication and propagation, whereby it is speculated that the p53 pathway is first turned off, which helps the virus proliferate. Afterwards, when viral propagation slows down, the virus again activates the pathway in a hyperactive way, increasing inflammation and damage to the cells.[28, 29] In Patients 2 and 3,  there seems to be an opposite trend to that—p53 is enriched in the moderate stage; in the other patients, including the deceased Patient 1, it is more enriched in the critical stage..

Discussion
It has been suggested that Covid-19 patients exhibit distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection with varying severities.[30] In this study, we sought to better understand differences in the immune response among different severity groups, as well as patients with different outcomes. 
In B cell repertoire analysis, special emphasis was given to the most common heavy-chain Immunoglobulin Heavy Variable (IGHV) genes, especially in combination with J genes; as these are thought to drive the most variation in B cell receptors.[31] The most common V gene in our data set, IGHV3-23, has been reported in other COVID-19 studies as well.[32-34] IGHV3-23 has also been found to be associated with aggressive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) where it is highly mutated,[35] indicating bad prognosis.[36] 
 IGHV4-34, the second most commonly used V gene, mostly in one of our deceased patients, is associated with self-reactive antibodies,[37] and has also been previously observed in COVID-19 patients.[34, 38] Interestingly, Galson et al.[38] reported the usage of this V gene to be significantly higher in B cells with the IgG1 isotype in improving COVID-19 patients than those in stable or deteriorating patients, while in our data set, IGHV-34 associated with IgG1 was mostly detected in one of the deteriorating (and eventually deceased) patients.
IGHV3-33 was the third most common V gene, in combination with IGHJ4. Other studies also identified an increase in this gene in association with COVID-19.[32, 38, 39]  It is also noteworthy that IGHV3-33 has been detected in potent antibodies in the recipients of malaria vaccination. [40]
IGHV1-18–IGHJ3 was the most common gene segment combination in Patient 1’s critical sample. It has been reported that use of this gene is elevated in acute dengue “without warning signs”[41], and has been identified as first in a panel of biomarkers for predicting complete remission to treatment in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis.[42] IGHV1-18 is also associated with tumor immunity, and others have detected it as a positive prognostic marker gene in immune cells in the melanoma tumor microenvironment.[43, 44]
In line with expectation and previous literature,[32]  our data showed lower BCR V gene usage diversity in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. However, contrary to others’ findings[30], we found that the proportion of expanded clones (3 cells or more) was significantly higher in critical/severe cases than in mild/moderate ones (p =0.008).
