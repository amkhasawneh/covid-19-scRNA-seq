Introduction
	what do we know so far? General COVID responses of Tcells and Bcells
Adaptive immunity is crucial in viral clearance and its response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been extensively investigated in a global effort to manage the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Cell-mediated and humoral adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 manifest in a broad range from asymptomatic to mild symptoms of fever and flu, to more serious cases with lymphopenia, overactivation of immune cells that end in cell exhaustion, and an interferon-driven immunopathology causing the “cytokine storm” [1]. The clinical features and interpatient variability in the progression of COVID-19 patients show the complexity of this disease and that a precise targeted treatment is necessary. 
	why focus on repertoire analysis?
Earlier studies on SARS-CoV-2 have focused on neutralizing antibodies, but a growing number highlight the importance of a robust memory B and T lymphocytes as protective immunity for a longer period than the more transient neutralizing antibodies, allowing for the efficient production of effector cells and antibodies upon further exposure and/or reinfection to COVID-19 [2-7]. 
The major goal of B and T lymphocyte receptor analysis is to identify significant features in the repertoire that can be used as predictive measures for virus susceptibility and fatal outcomes. Using single-cell RNA and BCR/TCR sequencing, we look into adaptive immune responses to COVID-19 during the moderate and critical stages of the disease, in relation to the transcriptomic landscape at the receptor level. This study is divided into two major themes: 1) receptor repertoire analysis of B and T cells to describe the diversity of the repertoire based on the clonal expansion and binding affinity of the receptors; and 2) gene expression analysis of expanded T cell clones and the whole B cell repertoire to determine the differential genes and pathways enhanced throughout the course of the disease.


Upon stimulation, B cells switch from naïve B cells with IgM or IgD antibodies/receptors to (eventually) antibody-producing plasma cells secreting IgA, IgG, or IgE. Whereas B cell receptor affinity for an antigen is improved through somatic hypermutation in the variable region (mostly in the V and J genes), this process of changing Ig type, termed class switching, is achieved through recombination in the B cell’s heavy chain’s constant region, and improves a receptor’s effector functions.[8, 9] 

Materials and Methods
Sample collection
A total of 15 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analysed: 12 samples were collected from 6 COVID-19 inpatients admitted into Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, at several points in time with different stages of disease progression (see Table S1 for patient information); and 3 samples were collected from 3 healthy donors. The median age for patients was 76 years (range: 53-93), and all but Patient 1 were male.
As shown in Table S1, Patients 1 to 4 are cases in which specimens were collected at the time of transition from moderate to the critical stage, and Patients 5 and 6 are cases in which specimens were collected at the stage of transition from critical to moderate. Patients 1, 2, and 3 are dead cases, and Patients 4, 5, and 6 are surviving cases. 
SARS-CoV-2 infection was established through RT-PCR-based molecular testing, and was performed using nasopharyngeal specimens by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).[10] 
We categorized SARS-CoV-2 infection patients as mild, moderate, severe, or critical according to the WHO criteria[11]. Mild COVID-19 was defined as respiratory symptoms without evidence of pneumonia or hypoxia, while moderate or severe infection was defined as the presence of clinical and radiological evidence of pneumonia. In moderate cases, SpO2 ≥94% was observed on room air, while one of the following was required to identify the severe and critical cases: respiratory rate >30 breaths/min or SpO2 <94% on room air. Critical illness was defined as respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction (COVID-19 Clinical management: living guidance.[11]). Clinical background data was obtained by accessing the patients’ records at the hospital.
This study complied with all relevant national regulations and institutional policies. It was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Juntendo University Hospital (IRB # 20-037. #20-051). Written, informed consent was obtained from all individuals included in this study.


Sample processing 
PBMCs were isolated using BD Vacutainer CPT tubes according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The collected cells were suspended in 1 mL of CELLBANKER 1 plus (Nihon Zenyaku Kogyo, Koriyama, Japan), frozen at -80°C, and then used for flow cytometry analysis and 10x single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Serum samples were stored at -80°C prior to use.

Single cell RNA-seq assay (10x platform) 
PBMC suspensions were barcoded through the 10x Chromium Single Cell platform using Chromium Next GEM single cell 5’ GEM reagent kits v2 (PN-1000263, 10x Genomics, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The loaded cells numbered approximately 1.6 × 104, aiming for 1.0 × 104 single cells per reaction on the Chip K Single Cell Kit (PN-1000286, 10x Genomics) with the Chromium controller (10x Genomics). Single-cell RNA libraries were prepared, and unique sample indexes added using the library construction kit, the Single Index Kit T Set A (PN-1000213, 10x Genomics), and a universal library conversion kit (App-A, cat. No. 1000004155, MGI, China). The libraries were sequenced using the DNBSEQ-G400 platform (MGI).

Data processing
Raw sequencing reads in FASTQ format were analyzed using the Cell Ranger (10x Genomics, version 6.1.2) multi pipeline, performing gene expression (GEX) alignment against the GRCh38 human reference dataset (10x Genomics) with a SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (GenBank: LC606022.1) appended. V(D)J assembly and alignment and paired clonotype calling for T and B cell receptors were done against the refdata-cellranger-vdj-GRCh38-alts-ensembl-5.0.0 reference (10x Genomics). CDR3 sequences and rearranged full-length BCR/TCR V(D)J segments as well as clonotype frequency were also obtained.

Single-cell RNA-seq
Downstream single-cell data analysis of Cell Ranger’s output expression count matrices was performed using the R programming language (version 4.2.1)[12] with the Seurat package (version 4.0).[13]	All samples were integrated into one dataset, categorized according to severity and patient identity. Cell cycle phases were determined for each cell, which were judged to have no discernible effect on the variation of the data. Upon evaluation of the quality of the gene counts, the collective sample was restricted to cells associated with more than 500 transcripts, more than 250 genes, and less than 20% mitochondrial genes. Genes with zero counts were also removed from the dataset. After this filtration, 129,469 cells were kept for further analysis. 
The data were normalized, and variable features determined for clustering the cells. The Azimuth web application was used for cluster annotation,[13] and UMAP dimensionality reduction was used to view the resulting cell clusters/types. Azimuth annotations were used as cell type identifiers in further analysis. To account for interpatient variability, subsequent analyses were performed comparing individual patients.

Immune repertoire analysis
Gene expression data matrices from the scRNA-seq analysis were subset to two groups: T cells (CD3-enriched cells), and B cells. To these were integrated the clonotype filtered contig data for each library in the scRepertoire R package (version 1.7.0)[14] using the CombineTCR and CombineBCR functions. Only productive TCR/BCR sequences were kept for subsequent analysis. TCR/BCR repertoire analysis was performed using the Seurat and scRepertoire packages in R. 

Antigen specificity prediction
The amino acid sequences of the TCRβ-CDR3 region were used to predict the specificity to a known antigen referenced in four public databases (McPAS [15], vdjdb [16], TCRex [17], and TCRMatch [18]), following criteria described by Gantner et al. [19] and Meysman et al [20]. A conservative threshold of 97-100% sequence similarity to the reference sequences was observed and considered of high probability of sharing specificity.

Differential gene expression and gene-set enrichment analysis
To identify the genes differentially expressed during each severity state for each patient, the moderate/mild stage was compared to the critical stage using the Wilcoxon test (fold-change of >1.5; adjusted p-value < 0.05), by either the Seurat function FindAllMarkers (Bonferroni correction) for T cells, or the wilcoxauc (permutation testing) function from the presto package for B cells.[21] The extracted differentially-expressed genes were then used to perform gene set enrichment analysis using the Hallmark functional gene set.[22] 
Differential gene expression analysis was also performed between similar severity stages between different patient classifications—deceased vs. surviving in the critical stage, and deteriorating vs. improving in the mild/moderate stage. The identified marker genes were input into g:Profiler for functional profiling queries (g:GOSt) against the GO biological process gene ontology.[23] The results were mapped to enrichment networks in Cytoscape[24] to visualize pathway overlap between the different patients in corresponding severity stages, and pathway clusters were generated using MCODE[25] to infer the relationships between the pathways and group them by theme. 

Statistical analysis
The Shannon index was used to calculate the V gene usage and Ig isotype diversity scores for the individual samples,[26] and Wilcoxon’s test was used to compare the clonal and isotype diversity indices between samples, to compare isotype proportions, and to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different subsets of the data.[27] In all statistical comparisons, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the R programming language.[12]

Results
Thirty cell clusters were identified by the Azimuth application across 129,469 cells. Of these, 30,071 (23.2%) were from the samples of the healthy donors, 15,493 (11.9%) were from the COVID-19 patients’ samples in mild stage, 32,182 (25%) in moderate stage, and 51,723 (%) in critical stage (Figure 1). Fine resolution clustering of mRNA profiles revealed 13 clusters of T lymphocytes that include CD4 and Treg subtypes, CD8 subtypes, MAIT cells, double-negative T cells (dnT), and gamma-delta T cells (gdT); the detected B cell subtypes were B intermediate, B memory, B naïve, and Plasmablasts.

T cell clusters
	To characterize clonal expansion and function of the clustered T lymphocytes, these cells were merged with the TCR-seq data to incorporate single-cell RNA profiles with T cell receptors and filter out cells without TCR information. Only cells with either an α- or β-, or both TCR chains were included in this analysis, narrowing the clusters down to eleven, as dnT and gdT cells were removed. 	
Compared to healthy controls, naïve T cells were significantly reduced in all six patients indicating the activation of adaptive immune response upon infection. CD4 central memory (CD4+ TCM), helper T cells surviving the effector purge that differentiate to dormant T cells, and CD8 effector memory cells (CD8+ TEM), cytotoxic T cells that migrate to infection sites immediately upon TCR stimulation, were highly enhanced in all patients throughout the course of the infection (Figure 1B), with CD4 TCM cells accounting for 52% of the total T lymphocytes, and CD8 TEM at 30%. 
Proportions of CD8 TEM cells were reduced as the disease progressed from moderate/mild to critical in Patients 1–4 (except Patient 2, where CD8 TEM cells were stable), while CD4 TCM cells increased. An opposite pattern was observed in Patients 5–6 as they recovered from critical to moderate stages: CD8 TEM cells increasing and CD4 TCM decreasing. 
These clonally expanded T cells may represent SARS-COV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells showing concomitant response in the adaptive immune system
Antigen specificity prediction
The efficiency of cellular immune responses after infection with SARS-CoV-2 is ultimately linked to the availability and frequency of T cell receptors reactive to viral epitopes [28]. To describe the general response of the T cell receptors in terms of its reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, we cross-referenced the CDR3 region of the TCR β-chain to four public TCR databases (McPAS, vdjdb, TCRex, and TCRMatch). 
Of the 46,387 clonotypes identified for T lymphocytes, only 6,123 of the CDR3β sequences were matched at 97 – 100% sequence similarity to reference viral and bacterial antigens: 3,762 of these expressed high affinity to SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens (Table S2). Despite the low turnout limited by available public references, the matched CDR3β sequences can still illustrate the general affinity of the TCR repertoire to SARS-CoV-2.
Further matching of COVID-19 patient clonotypes revealed primary responses to SARS-CoV-2 are reactive with epitopes derived from ORF1ab, spike protein, nucleoprotein, and other accessory proteins (Figure/Table Xa). Overall, most of the clonotypes are reactive to the ORF1ab, the largest gene encoding for the non-structural proteins. Surprisingly, healthy controls recognize most epitope regions to a similar extent as the COVID-19 patients, with an average 10–16% of the total clonotype population reactive to SARS-CoV-2, more frequent matches than progressing Patients 1–4, whose TCR repertoire had returned lesser CDR3β matches with the public references. This suggests that recognition of SARS-CoV-2 is a result of cross-reactivity elicited by exposure to other pathogens [29]. Second are clonotypes responsive to the spike protein, with similar frequency in both COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. While the limited availability of reference sequences could have affected these results, it can also suggest a pre-existing immune repertoire in the general human population that could respond against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The majority of the TCR data were unmatched with the reference sequences owing to the tendency of COVID-19 patients to proliferate private clonotypes during infection. 
In contrast, a monoclonal expansion was observed during the moderate stage of Patient 1, in which clonotypes were highly reactive to the ORF8 epitopes and drastically decreased as the patient progressed to critical. However, the patients with a similar disease progression (Patient 2–4) as Patient 1 did not exhibit this pattern.
To identify ORF1ab- and spike-specific T lymphocyte subtypes in healthy controls and COVID-19 patients, we combined the scTCR-seq and scRNA-seq data to assess the T cell clonal expansion of the matched clonotypes (Figure Xb). An abundant number of receptors responsive to ORF1ab and spike epitope regions in healthy controls were recovered in the CD8+ naïve subtype, stressing a robust immune repertoire present in unexposed individuals. The expanded subtypes, CD4 TCM and CD8 TEM, are consistently reactive to both ORF1ab and spike regions; however, it is notable that the control group also exhibited CD4 TCM and CD8 TEM receptors with high affinity to these protein regions. Among patients, no pattern was found in the expansion of the ORF1ab- and spike-specific TCRs in terms of disease severity, progression, or patient outcome.

TCR V-J gene usage bias
The initial T cell response to infection is to produce a clone of identical TCRs that equips the body with enough infection-specific lymphocytes for an effective immune response. We then assess the SARS-CoV-2-driven clonal expansion of CD4 TCM and CD8 TEM receptors. We define clonotypes based on the V-J region and CDR3 sequences of the more stable TCRβchain. 
To investigate the usage preferences and clonal changes of TCR, we compare the usage frequency of the TRBV and TRBJ genes of CD4 TCM and CD8 TEM cell subtypes between patients and healthy controls. Top V-J usage for both controls and infected patients include TRBV20-1, TRBV28, and TRBV19, in conjunction with TRBJ2-1, TRBJ2-3, TRBJ2-5, and TRBJ2-7. TRBV5-1 also has high occurrence in all samples, except for Healthy Control 3. 
V-J usage pattern for CD4 TCM cells expanded common clonotypes for infected patients and even in controls, as well as a more diverse usage combination of the V-gene with the J region. But CD8 TEM V-J usage was extremely variable for each patient, and V-J usage was less diverse.
In CD8 TEM cells, controls have a higher diversity of V-J usage compared to the infected patients, in which patients would have monoclonal expansions of J gene. No common expanded clones were observed in the CD8 TEM subtype of the infected patients, but controls all had TRBV20-1 enriched. The top 5 most abundant V-J clones (See Table S5) were mostly expressed in Patient 6 where it expanded from zero in the critical to hundreds as Patient 6 recovered to moderate state. However, this pattern was not observed in Patient 5, another recovering patient. Patient 5 had very low CD8 TEM cell count during the critical state, much lower compared to all other patients in the critical. The expansion was tenfold for CD8 TEM cells as Patient 5 recovered to moderate; however the V-J clonal expansions were fewer than 50 cells unlike Patient 6 where clonal count ranges from ~2 – 300. Progressing patients had a decreasing cell count trend based on V-J usage, except for Patient 3 where cell count of TRBV7-2.TRBJ2-7 exceptionally expanded 20X. 
Taken together, CD4 TCM cells are shown to be more public among patients and CD8 TEM cells more patient-specific.
Identification of common DEGS among expanded TRBV regions: Pre-critical vs post-critical moderate state
To understand the functions of the highly expanded cell type at the T cell receptor level, the differential gene expression has been analyzed in enriched T cells with the top V-gene usage identified from the TCR repertoire analysis. We focused on CD4 TCM cells which consistently have TRBV20-1, TRBV5-1, and TRBV19 as the most abundant TRBV regions, unlike CD8 TEM cell types that have varying TRBV gene usage for each patient. 
To investigate the changes in each patient’s transcriptome throughout the duration of the disease, we compare moderate/mild and critical differences in gene expression (threshold parameters: avg log2FC > 0.58; Bonferroni p-adj < 0.05). While all patients underwent critical state around 11-14 days from onset of the COVID-19 infection, the moderate/mild stages were of two different timepoints. Patient 1 – 4 were sampled during the early stages of the disease (2-5 days from onset) before progressing to the critical state. Patient 5 and 6, however were sampled during the recovery phase of the disease (41 days and 29 days, respectively, after onset). In this section, we performed differential gene expression analysis with comparison between the progressing group vs the recovering group to determine upregulated genes and pathways for each group.
The expression patterns differed significantly between moderate and critical conditions for patients 1 – 4, where inflammatory genes, such as IFI44L, IFITM1, IFI6, ISG15, XAF1, STAT1, LY6E, B2M, MX1 were highly expressed during moderate/mild stage, while ribosomal and elongation proteins (RPS, RPL, and EEF1) dominate the critical state of Patient 1 to 4. In contrast, critical states of Patient 5 and 6 upregulated genes involved in cellular respiration and energy transport, along with genes expressing ribosomal proteins in moderate stage compared to critical stage. As Patient 5 and 6 recovered to moderate, fewer genes were differentially expressed, but mitochondrial genes (MT-CO1, MT-CYB, MT-ND4L) were prominent. The complete list of differentially expressed genes for each subset is summarized in Table S1. We further performed the gene overlap analysis of the three TRBV subset for each patient to understand the functions of the expanded TRBV regions (Figure 3) and observed that these findings were consistent for all three TRBV subsets. While TRBV5-1 and TRBV19 have genes mostly overlapping with other TRBV subsets, TRBV20-1 had a greater number of exclusive genes, whether upregulated or downregulated in almost all patients. The upregulated exclusive genes from TRBV20-1 of Patient 1 – 4 are mostly inflammatory genes and the downregulated genes are ribosomal and elongation proteins. 

Pathway identification by gene set enrichment analysis
To further understand the functions for each TRBV subset, we identified the activated biological pathways, using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of functional Hallmark gene sets, of upregulated genes during the moderate stages taken from different timepoints of the disease (Figure 4). 
In general, a number of gene sets related to immune response were enriched in all patients. At the same time, pathways involved in proliferation and signaling were downregulated. This pattern was observed in all TRBV subsets, and no distinctions were found among them.
Consistent with the differentially expressed genes, Interferon-αand Interferon-γresponses were the most enriched pathways during the moderate state of progressing patients 1-4 in all TRBV subset. In contrast, MYC targets regulating several receptor-signaling functions of virus-infected host cells were highly downregulated in the moderate state of progressing patients. While INF pathways were also enriched during the moderate state of Patients 5 and 6, enrichment scores are lower compared to progressing patients. Metabolic processes such as fatty acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation were activated in all three TRBV subsets for Patient 5 and 6, except for a suppression for Patient 5 in TRBV20-1. Proliferation and signaling pathways, as well as hypoxia, were downregulated in Patient 5 and 6. 
Surviving vs deceased patients
In an effort to understand the response of surviving patients compared to deceased patients throughout the duration of the COVID-19 infection, we identified DEGs by comparing the critical state of deceased patients (Patient 1 – 3) and critical state of surviving patients (Patient 4 – 6).  Then, we performed over-representation analysis in g:Profiler with default thresholds using GO Biological Processes database, which is then mapped to an enrichment network in Cytoscape to determine the shared pathways of each patient during their critical state. Since TRBV5-1 and TRBV19 showed redundant CD4 TCM functions, only cells with TRBV20-1 were used in this analysis. 
Based on MCODE and MCL cluster algorithms, two major clusters of pathways were detected (Figure 5). In the surviving cases, the biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, and cytoplasmic translation pathway regulation were activated in Cluster 1. Patient 1 had 19 upregulated genes when compared to critical states of the surviving patients, but only cytoplasmic translation pathway was significantly enriched, involving RPL17, RPS29, RPS4X, RPL38. This pathway was also enriched in all the surviving patients. Patient 2 and 3 are grouped in Cluster 2 wherein energy transport and oxidative phosphorylation were activated. 

B cell clusters
Integration of the V(D)J sequences into the scRNA-seq data yielded 6734 B cells—2265 Plasmablasts (33.6%), 2381 B naïve (35.4%), 648 B memory (9.6%), and 1440 B intermediate (21.4%) cells.
As shown in Figure 2 (BCR), at all stages of COVID-19 patients examined in this study, the percentage of plasmablasts was significantly higher than in healthy controls. However, changes in the proportion of plasmablasts according to severity differed from case to case and no consistent trends were observed. Patients 1–4 all progressed from moderate to critical stages, but in Patients 1 and 2 plasmablasts increased as they progressed to critical stages, while in Patients 3 and 4, the plasmablast ratio at critical stages decreased compared to moderate stages. In Patients 5 and 6, who recovered from the critical to moderate stage, plasmablasts increased and decreased during their recovery process, respectively. Of note, intermediate B cells showed changes opposite to increases and decreases in plasmablasts in all cases. The proportion of B naive cells decreased with progression from moderate to critical in dead cases (Pt1, Pt2, Pt3), but increased in the survivor (Pt4). In survivors Pt5 and Pt6, the proportion of B naive cells decreased with recovery from critical to moderate stage. 

BCR V-J gene usage bias
	We then investigated BCR V gene usage diversity. The diversity of BCR V gene usage was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p value = 0.0029). The proportion of expanded clones (3 cells or more) was significantly higher in critical cases than in moderate ones (p =0.008). However, when comparing different outcomes in COVID-19 patients, we found no significant difference in BCR V gene diversity between deceased and recovered patients. 
The most abundant V–J gene usage combination was IGHV3-23–IGHJ4, which was expressed in all samples regardless of disease status and severity. The second highest frequency was with IGHV4-34–IGHJ5, mostly detected in the deceased Patient 2’s critical sample (Figure 2). Of particular interest was the IGH1-18 gene, coupled most commonly with IGHJ3 in the deceased Patient 1 in the critical (and terminal) stage. Also of interest was IGHV4-39, most highly used in Patient 3’s (deceased) critical sample. This gene has also been used for CLL prognostication, and as a marker for progression into Richter Syndrome.[30]
J gene usage analysis revealed preferential usage of the IGHJ4 gene for all samples, except for Patient 2, whose critical sample showed a predominance of IGHJ5 usage. No significant difference was found in J gene usage diversity across the samples.
Concerning isotype diversity, there were more diverse isotypes in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p = 0.0059), which is the opposite direction to V gene usage diversity. No significant difference in isotype diversity was found between deceased and recovered patients. In our collective data set, the most common isotype was IgM; it was also the most common Ig type in the individual samples except those of Patient 2 and Patient 3—both deceased. Patient 2 had larger proportions of IgA1, IgA2, and IgG1; and Patient 3 had IgA1 in the largest proportions. The use of IgA1 was significantly higher in the deceased than in the recovered patients (p = 0.0013) and healthy controls (p = 0.024)


Differential Gene Expression in B Cells
In the moderate/mild stages in deteriorating patients (Patients 1-4), there was a preponderance of upregulated inflammatory genes, whereas in the critical stages of these patients, ribosomal proteins were prominent. The transcriptomic profiles for the recovering Patients 5 and 6 similarly showed upregulated ribosomal proteins in the critical stage, and fewer inflammatory genes and more metabolic and biosynthetic genes in the moderate stages. (Fig. 4B)

Pathway Enrichment in B Cells
Comparing pathway enrichment between the patients’ B cells showed significant differences in the moderate (deteriorating vs. recovering) and critical (deceased vs. surviving) stages. (Fig. 5B)
In the moderate stage, deteriorating patients showed more enrichment of the Interferon Alpha/Gamma Response pathways compared to the recovering patients. Among the pathways enriched in the recovering patients in the moderate stage, TNFA signalling via NFKB and the MYC Targets V1 pathway were of note. 
In the critical stage, we compared deceased and surviving patients. Here, the TNFA signalling pathway and p53 were downregulated in the deceased patients 2 and 3, and Oxidative Phosphorylation and the mTORC1 pathway were enriched. In both severity stages, the deceased patients had higher enrichment scores for the complement pathway, though significant difference was only observed in Patient 2.
Gene ontology analysis also showed differences among the patients. In the moderate stage, metabolic and biosynthetic pathways were prominent in Patients 5 and 6, and some of them were shared with Patient 2. In Patient 2, protein folding and transport pathways were also prominently enriched. In the deteriorating patients, regulation, immune response, and regulatory pathways were also prominent. (Fig. 6B) In the critical stage, metabolic and regulatory pathway enrichment was more pronounced in the deceased patients, while surviving patients had upregulated biosynthetic processes.

Discussion
It has been suggested that Covid-19 patients exhibit distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection with varying severities.[31] In this study, we sought to better understand differences in the immune response among different severity groups, as well as patients with different outcomes. 
	Discuss CD4 as highly expanded in most cases
Central memory CD4+ (CD4 TCM) cells retain information of prior infections and proliferate upon exposure to antigen, signaling the production of antigen-specific lymphocytes [32]. Compared to other CD4 T cells, CD4 TCM occupied most of the peripheral blood samples in all six patients at any given time in the course of COVID-19 infection. The CD4 TCM cell count, however, increased as patients progressed from moderate to critical, and decreased for patients recovering from critical to moderate state. Although other studies report a general decline in cell counts as severity progresses [3],  progressing cases that underwent memory T cell expansion expressed lower functional avidity to target antigens [7], and prevented naïve cells from differentiating to effector cells with higher avidity. 
	Discuss CD4 TCM in healthy donors
The role of CD4 TCM cells as first responder demands a robust receptor repertoire capable of recognizing numerous peptides [33, 34].  While 62% of CD4 TCM cells in our data are COVID-19-specific, a large portion is cross-reactive to other viral antigens, e.g., Cytomegalovirus (CMV), that had infected most of the human population, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and Influenza (Table S2). However, no significant difference was shown in the cross-reactivity between deceased and recovered patients of CD4 TCM cells to SARS-CoV-2 and other antigens. 
In the control group, frequency of CD4 and CD8 naïve cells were higher compared to COVID-19 patients, yet CD4 TCM cells of healthy donors occupy most of the repertoire. 
Recent data have shown that T cells are responsible for the protection of individuals with no prior infection of SARS-CoV-2 [35], and COVID-19-specific memory T cells have also been detected in unexposed donors and pre-pandemic populations [3, 35, 36]. In addition, non-structural proteins were found to be more reactive to T cells of unexposed donors than COVID-19 patients [6]; as with the case of SARS, ORF1ab-specific T cells were more dominant in healthy controls while T cells of SARS patients and recovered individuals are bias towards structural protein regions [37]. Likewise, our data reports healthy donors with naïve and memory T cell receptors reactive to the ORF1ab region, with a sizable number of receptors also reactive to the spike protein.
	Discuss difference between CD4 and CD8 expansion. Why V-J gene of CD4 is more convergent, CD8 VJ usage is patient-specific
The vigorous proliferation of CD4 memory cells in both control and COVID-19 patients highlights its protective role prior and during the infection that CD4 TCM cells could be selected as biomarkers for patient prognosis and targeted immunotherapy. In particular, the V-J gene usage in our data shows high publicity among CD4 memory cells, with V-J gene usage comparable among patients, regardless of severity, and even among healthy controls. This publicity allowed us to perform several subsequent gene expression analyses using CD4 TCM cells. 
Usually, however, antigen-specific T cells are more often private [38]. This is the case with CD8 TEM cells in our data where the frequency of V-J gene usage is variable among patients. In CD8 cells, the effector memory subtype was highly expanded in COVID-19 patients, especially during the moderate stage of progressing patients. Recovering patients, however, had an increasing pattern in CD8 TEM cells during their moderate state. No patterns were found in the epitope prediction analysis, that corroborates with the report of high avidity of CD8 memory T cells in mild patients, and CD8 T cells reactive to a few unique OFR1ab peptides were observed in severe cases [39]. However, Patient 1 was unique with the vast expansion of CD8 TEM cells in the moderate state and an abrupt decline in critical, possibly due to cell exhaustion. These CD8 memory T cells were also highly reactive to the spike and ORF8 protein in Patient 1 alone. It was ideal to look more into the phenotypic characteristics of these CD8 memory cells, especially with Patient 1, but the non-convergence of the T cell receptors limited any further analyses on CD8 T cells. 
	Discuss gene expression analysis moderate vs critical per patient and TRBV subsets
CD4 T cells in general have been described to sustain inflammation with elevated interferon (INF)-α, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and INF-γwith increasing SARS-CoV-2 severity. Progressing patients, during the moderate state, had a higher enrichment score for interferon responses compared to recovering patients. Although recovering Patient 5 and 6 also activated interferon pathways in the moderate stage, only B2M and STAT1 inflammatory genes were differentially expressed. 
In contrast, mitochondrial genes were upregulated in Patient 5 and 6 during the moderate state. Deregulation of pathways linked to mitochondrial function is linked to severe cases and poor outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infection [40-42].
To be polished later….
The TNF signaling via NFKB pathway known for the activation of cytokines involved in cellular proliferation and survival of T cells were mostly suppressed in the moderate/mild conditions of all patients for all TRBV subsets, except in the TRBV20-1 and TRBV5-1 subsets of Patient 3. SARS-CoV-19 infection also inhibits oxidative phosphorylation functions [43] resulting in an imbalanced mitochondrial response. But as viral titers decline, normal mitochondrial functions resurge to repair tissue damage. During moderate state, the oxidative phosphorylation pathway was enriched in Patient 4 and 6 but was suppressed in Patient 5. The upregulation of mitochondrial genes during the moderate state in Patient 5 and Patient 6 was evident as previously described. 

Although previous studies have reported no difference in the transcriptomes of clonally expanded and nonclonally expanded T cells (Wang et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2019), no reports were made for differential gene expression between expanded clones and between severities – to the best of our knowledge.

Overall, our results show clear distinctions between moderate and critical stages for each patient based on differentially expressed genes; however, the highly expanded TRBV regions of interest in the CD4 TCM cell types performed similar functions despite a significant number of exclusive gene set for TRBV20-1. Nevertheless, our approach of a separate analysis for each TRBV region identified distinct individual cellular, disentangling individual cellular responses, and hence patient-to-patient variability. 
	Discuss biological pathways during critical state of dead vs recovered patients


In line with expectation and earlier literature,[44]  our data showed lower BCR V gene usage diversity in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. Also similar to others’ findings[31], we found that the proportion of expanded clones (3 cells or more) was significantly higher in critical/severe cases than in mild/moderate ones (p =0.008). Previously, Zhang et al.[45] reported higher clonal expansion and higher diversity in response to SARS-CoV-2. These varying trends are possibly the result of differences between the cohorts each of these studies (and ours) examined.
In B cell repertoire analysis, special emphasis was given to the most common heavy-chain Immunoglobulin Heavy Variable (IGHV) genes, especially in combination with J genes; as these are thought to drive the most variation in B cell receptors.[46] The most common V gene in our data set, IGHV3-23, has been reported in other COVID-19 studies as well.[44, 47, 48] IGHV3-23 has also been found to be associated with aggressive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) where it is highly mutated,[49] indicating bad prognosis.[50] 
 IGHV4-34, the second most commonly used V gene, mostly in one of our deceased patients, is associated with self-reactive antibodies,[51] and has also been previously observed in COVID-19 patients.[31, 48, 52] Interestingly, Galson et al.[52] reported the usage of this V gene to be significantly higher in B cells with the IgG1 isotype in improving COVID-19 patients than those in stable or deteriorating patients, while in our data set, IGHV-34 associated with IgG1 was mostly detected in one of the deteriorating (and eventually deceased) patients.
IGHV3-33 was the third most common V gene, in combination with IGHJ4. Other studies also identified an increase in this gene in association with COVID-19.[44, 52, 53]  It is also noteworthy that IGHV3-33 has been detected in potent antibodies in the recipients of malaria vaccination. [54]
IGHV1-18–IGHJ3 was the most common gene segment combination in Patient 1’s critical sample. It has been reported that use of this gene is elevated in acute dengue “without warning signs”[55], and has been identified as first in a panel of biomarkers for predicting complete remission to treatment in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis.[56] IGHV1-18 is also associated with tumor immunity, and others have detected it as a positive prognostic marker gene in immune cells in the melanoma tumor microenvironment.[57, 58]
The Interferon Alpha and Interferon Gamma pathways were enriched in the deceased patients compared to the surviving patients in the moderate stage. This is in agreement with the observed significant differences in IgA1 proportions between the two groups, as Interferon Alpha stimulates Ig class-switching,[59]. This pathway also induces B cell maturation into plasmablasts,[60] whose proportions are higher in the deceased cohort. The Interferon Alpha pathway has also been reported to play a role in stimulating clonal expansion and cell differentiation.[60] Interferon Gamma also regulates class switching and Ig secretion.[61, 62] Comparing the deteriorating patients (moderate to critical) to the improving ones yielded similar gene set enrichment profiles in the moderate stage to the ones above, suggesting an upregulation trend in the deteriorating patients in inflammatory and Interferon pathways. On the other hand, moderate samples of the surviving patients had higher enrichment of the TNFA signalling via NFKB pathway. Downregulation of this signalling pathway has been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases.[63, 64] This suggests that this might be a prognostic factor whose downregulation predicts patient deterioration. The MYC Targets V1 pathway was enriched in improving patients, as well. This pathway is thought to promote cell proliferation through involvement in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation.[65, 66] Enrichment of this pathway in the recovering patients might be indicative of tissue repair after inflammation.
Pathways enriched in Patients 2 and 3 compared to recovered patients in the critical stage included Oxidative Phosphorylation. This process is important in innate immunity and T cell proliferation.[67, 68] Dysfunction in this pathway is thought to be associated with excessive release of reactive oxygen species and other inflammatory cytokines and enzymes involved in promoting hyperinflammation in sepsis, and might increase viral replication in diseased cells.[69] It is also believed that, through manipulating the metabolic and signalling functions of mitochondria, SARS-CoV (and potentially SARS-CoV-2) proteins can evade the immune system and alter the host’s anti-viral response.[70] It is possible that this kind of viral “hijacking” of the mitochondria is responsible for the high enrichment of this pathway. further supporting the idea that this pathway is indicative of a recovering immune system. 
The mTORC1 pathway was enriched in Patients 2 and 3 in this stage, as well, which is involved in regulating important immunological processes such as proliferation, metabolism, programmed cell death, and autophagy. It is also known to be sensitive to the immunosuppressant rapamycin, which has been suggested as a repurposed COVID-19 drug that regulates the abovementioned processes and inhibits cytokines. [71-74] At the same time, p53 was downregulated in these two deceased patients. Tumor protein p53 (coded by the gene TP53) is a tumor suppressor that plays a role in controlling cell division and safeguarding the genome from mutations.[75] Similar to other viruses, it is believed that the SARS-CoV viruses have developed mechanisms to degrade p53 and exploit the pathway to further virus replication and propagation, whereby it is speculated that the p53 pathway is first turned off, which helps the virus proliferate. Afterwards, when viral propagation slows down, the virus again activates the pathway in a hyperactive way, increasing inflammation and damage to the cells.[76, 77] In Patients 2 and 3,  there seems to be an opposite trend to that—p53 is enriched in the moderate stage; in the other patients, including the deceased Patient 1, it is more enriched in the critical than in the moderate stage.
The complement pathway was significantly enriched in Patient 2, especially in the critical stage. Earlier work with SARS-CoV has identified this pathway as a contributing factor to pathogenesis, being associated with higher levels of chemokines and cytokines in affected individuals.[78] 
Taken together, our results would suggest that there are different gene expression and pathway patters in the different patient groups, but also within the groups. While the deceased Patient 1 shared some enrichment patterns with Patients 2 and 3—upregulated interferon pathways, and downregulated TNFA signalling via NFKB and MYC Targets V1 pathways—the latter two patients had more in common with each other than with Patient 1. At the same time, there were differences between the patters observed in Patients 2 and 3 as well, such as complement pathway enrichment. This implies that although there are tangible differences between the surviving and recovering patients, individual differences between patients of the same category should also always be taken into account.
This study has several limitations. Firstly, the number of samples examined was small. This was especially the case with B cells, with differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analyses yielding less definitive results than in T cells, where cells were more abundant. Secondly, our patients had particular demographics; all donors were Japanese, and most of our patients were of old age, possibly precluding the ability to generalize the results to younger patients and/or non-Japanese patients. Thirdly, other SARS-CoV-2 strains have come about during the time the study was underway. Therefore, some discretion is warranted when considering applying our conclusions to other, newer variants of the virus.

Fig 3. V and J gene usage. X-axis labels are V genes; bars’ heights represent V gene percentage in each sample; colors represent J genes associated with respective V genes in CD4 TCM (A), CD8 TEM (B), and B cells (C). In C, the scale for the y-axis is 0-20%, except for Patient 2, where in the critical sample, the IGHV4-34 gene occupies over 40% of the V gene repertoire.

Fig 4. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis for each COVID-19 patient. A. CD4 TCM cells. The heatmaps visualizes the normalized expression values of the genes during the moderate and critical states for each patient, divided horizontally to separate the cells with the different TRBV genes. Below each heatmap is a Venn diagram showing the overlap of genes per TRBV subset that were upregulated and downregulated (in parentheses) during the moderate state, in comparison to the patient’s critical state. Genes in the non-intersection areas were defined as the specific gene sets of the cells. B. B cells.
