Materials and Methods
Sample collection
A total of 17 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analysed: 14 samples were collected from 6 COVID-19 inpatients admitted into Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, at several points in time with different stages of disease progression (see Table S1 for patient information); and 3 samples were collected from 3 healthy donors. The median age for patients was 76 years (range: 53-93). 
SARS-CoV-2 infection was established through RT-PCR-based molecular testing, and was performed using nasopharyngeal specimens by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).[1] Disease severity was determined based on the WHO criteria <https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2021-2>. Clinical background data was obtained by accessing the patients’ records at the hospital.

Sample processing 
PBMCs were isolated using BD Vacutainer CPT tubes according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The collected cells were suspended in 1 mL of CELLBANKER 1 plus (Nihon Zenyaku Kogyo, Koriyama, Japan), frozen at -80°C, and then used for flow cytometry analysis and 10x single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Serum samples were stored at -80°C prior to use.

Single cell RNA-seq assay (10x platform) 
PBMC suspensions were barcoded through the 10x Chromium Single Cell platform using Chromium Next GEM single cell 5’ GEM reagent kits v2 (PN-1000263, 10x Genomics, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The loaded cells numbered approximately 1.6 × 104, aiming for 1.0 × 104 single cells per reaction on the Chip K Single Cell Kit (PN-1000286, 10x Genomics) with the Chromium controller (10x Genomics). Single-cell RNA libraries were prepared, and unique sample indexes added using the library construction kit, the Single Index Kit T Set A (PN-1000213, 10x Genomics), and a universal library conversion kit (App-A, cat. No. 1000004155, MGI, China). The libraries were sequenced using the DNBSEQ-G400 platform (MGI).

Data processing
Raw sequencing reads in FASTQ format were analyzed using the Cell Ranger (10x Genomics, version 6.1.2) multi pipeline, performing gene expression (GEX) alignment against the GRCh38 human reference dataset (10x Genomics) with a SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (GenBank: LC606022.1) appended. V(D)J assembly and alignment and paired clonotype calling for T and B cell receptors were done against the refdata-cellranger-vdj-GRCh38-alts-ensembl-5.0.0 reference (10x Genomics). CDR3 sequences and rearranged full-length BCR/TCR V(D)J segments as well as clonotype frequency were also obtained.

Single-cell RNA-seq
Downstream single-cell data analysis of Cell Ranger’s output expression count matrices was performed using the R programming language (version 4.2.1)[2] with the Seurat package (version 4.0).[3]	All samples were integrated into one dataset, categorized according to severity and patient identity. Cell cycle phases were determined for each cell, which were confirmed to have no discernible effect on the variation of the data. Upon evaluation of the quality of the gene counts, the collective sample was restricted to cells associated with more than 500 transcripts, more than 250 genes, and less than 20% mitochondrial genes. Genes with zero counts were also removed from the dataset. After this filtration, 139,987 cells were kept for further analysis. 
The data were normalized, and variable features determined for clustering the cells. The Azimuth web application was used for cluster annotation,[3] and UMAP dimensionality reduction was used to view the resulting cell clusters/types (Figure S1). Azimuth annotations were used as cell type identifiers in further analysis.

Immune repertoire analysis
Gene expression data matrices from the scRNA-seq analysis were subset to two groups: T cells (CD3-enriched cells), and B cells. To these were integrated the clonotype filtered contig data for each library in the scRepertoire R package (version 1.7.0)[4] using the CombineTCR and CombineBCR functions. Only productive TCR/BCR sequences were kept for subsequent analysis. TCR/BCR repertoire analysis was performed using the Seurat and scRepertoire packages in R. 

Statistical analysis
The Shannon index was used to calculate the diversity scores for the individual samples[5], and Wilcoxon’s test was used to compare the clonal diversity indices between samples, to compare isotype proportions, and to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different subsets of the data.[6] In all statistical comparisons, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the R programming language.[2]

Results
Single-cell transcriptional profiling
Thirty cell clusters were identified by the Azimuth application (Figure S1) across 139,987 cells. Of these, 30,071 (21.5%) were from the healthy donors, 15,493 (11.1%) from the mild group, 32,182 (23%) from the moderate group, 10518 (7.5%) from the severe group, and 51,723 (36.9%) from the critical group (Figure 1).
Upon examining the proportions of the different cell types among the severity groups, some interesting patterns emerged. In all but Patient 2, CD8 TEM cell numbers were inversely proportional to severity; on the other hand, all patients except Patient 5 had plasmablast numbers in direct proportion to severity. In Patient 4, a sharp increase in CD4 TCM and plasmablasts was observed with increased severity, accompanied by a decrease in CD8 TEM. Patient 6, who improved over the course of sample collection (from critical to severe to moderate), had a decrease in CD4 TCM, and an increase in CD8 TEM. Of note, in Patient 5, CD4 TCM cells and plasmablasts witnessed a sharp decrease between critical and severe states, but had an increase upon progressing into the moderate state.

BCR
After V(D)J sequence integration into the scRNA-seq data, we obtained 6955 cells classified as B cells by Azimuth—B intermediate (21.6%), B naïve (35.5%), B memory (9.6%), and Plasmablasts (33.3%). Most (42.4%) were from deceased patients’ samples, while 38.7% were from recovered patients, and 18.9% from healthy controls.
	Our data show that BCR V gene usage diversity was significantly higher in healthy controls than in COVID-19 patients (Wilcoxon’s test; p value = 2.9 × 10-3). This is in line with expectation and previous reports.[7] Comparing COVID-19 patients with different outcomes, however, showed no significant difference between deceased and recovered patients. Contrary to expectation and previous reports[8], no significant differences in V gene diversity were discerned among the different severity groups.
The most abundant V–J gene usage combination was IGHV4-34–IGHJ5. IGHV4-34, associated with self-reactive antibodies[9], has also previously been observed in COVID-19 patients.[10, 11] The second highest frequency was with IGHV3-23–IGHJ4 (Figure 2), also previously reported to be expanded in COVID-19.[7, 11, 12] IGHV3-33, predicted to play a role in the activation of the immune response, as well as in phagocytosis, was the third most common V gene, in combination with IGHJ4. Other studies also identified an increase in this gene in association with COVID-19.[7, 10, 13] It is also noteworthy that IGHV3-33 has been detected in potent antibodies in the recipients of malaria vaccination. [14]
Of particular interest was the IGH1-18 gene, observed most commonly with IGHJ3 in the deceased Patient 1 in the critical (and terminal) stage. It has been reported that use of this gene is elevated in acute dengue “without warning signs”[15], and has been identified as first in a panel of biomarkers for predicting complete remission to treatment in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis.[16] IGHV1-18 is also associated with tumor immunity, and others have detected it as a positive prognostic marker gene in immune cells in the melanoma tumor microenvironment.[17, 18]
J gene analysis revealed preferential usage of the IGHJ4 gene for all samples, except for Patient 2, whose samples showed a predominance of IGHJ6 usage. No significant difference was observed in the J gene usage diversity across the samples.
Upon stimulation, B cells switch from naïve B cells with IgM or IgD antibodies/receptors to (eventually) antibody-producing plasma cells secreting IgA, IgG, or IgE. Whereas affinity for an antigen is improved through somatic hypermutation in the variable region, this process of changing Ig type, termed class switching, is achieved through recombination in the heavy-chain constant region, and improves a receptor’s effector functions.[19, 20] In our collective data set, the most common isotype was IgM; it was also the most common Ig type in all samples except those of Patient 2 and Patient 3—both deceased. Patient 2 had larger proportions of IgA1, IgA2, and IgG1; and Patient 3 had IgA1 in the largest proportions. 
Isotype diversity showed a similar trend to that in V gene usage, but in the opposite direction: there were more diverse isotypes in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (Wilcoxon’s test; p value = 5.9 × 10-3). Again, no significant difference in isotype diversity was found between deceased and recovered patients.
We will next look for gene expression patterns characteristic of these ineffective clonotypes, which will help us better understand the underlying differences between patients with different outcomes and disease severities.

Discussion
It has been suggested that Covid-19 patients exhibit distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection with varying severities.[8] In this study, we sought to better understand differences in the immune response among different severity groups, as well as patients with different outcomes. In B cell repertoire analysis, special emphasis was given to the most common heavy-chain Immunoglobulin Heavy Variable (IGHV) genes, especially in combination with J genes; as these are thought to drive the most variation in B cell receptors.[21]
