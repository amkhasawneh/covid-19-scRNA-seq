Materials and Methods
Sample collection
A total of 17 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analysed: 14 samples were collected from 6 COVID-19 inpatients admitted into Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, at several points in time with different stages of disease progression (see Table S1 for patient information); and 3 samples were collected from 3 healthy donors. The median age for patients was 76 years (range: 53-93), and all but Patient 1 were male.
SARS-CoV-2 infection was established through RT-PCR-based molecular testing, and was performed using nasopharyngeal specimens by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).[1] Disease severity was determined based on the WHO criteria <https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2021-2>. Clinical background data was obtained by accessing the patients’ records at the hospital.

Sample processing 
PBMCs were isolated using BD Vacutainer CPT tubes according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The collected cells were suspended in 1 mL of CELLBANKER 1 plus (Nihon Zenyaku Kogyo, Koriyama, Japan), frozen at -80°C, and then used for flow cytometry analysis and 10x single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Serum samples were stored at -80°C prior to use.

Single cell RNA-seq assay (10x platform) 
PBMC suspensions were barcoded through the 10x Chromium Single Cell platform using Chromium Next GEM single cell 5’ GEM reagent kits v2 (PN-1000263, 10x Genomics, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The loaded cells numbered approximately 1.6 × 104, aiming for 1.0 × 104 single cells per reaction on the Chip K Single Cell Kit (PN-1000286, 10x Genomics) with the Chromium controller (10x Genomics). Single-cell RNA libraries were prepared, and unique sample indexes added using the library construction kit, the Single Index Kit T Set A (PN-1000213, 10x Genomics), and a universal library conversion kit (App-A, cat. No. 1000004155, MGI, China). The libraries were sequenced using the DNBSEQ-G400 platform (MGI).

Data processing
Raw sequencing reads in FASTQ format were analyzed using the Cell Ranger (10x Genomics, version 6.1.2) multi pipeline, performing gene expression (GEX) alignment against the GRCh38 human reference dataset (10x Genomics) with a SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (GenBank: LC606022.1) appended. V(D)J assembly and alignment and paired clonotype calling for T and B cell receptors were done against the refdata-cellranger-vdj-GRCh38-alts-ensembl-5.0.0 reference (10x Genomics). CDR3 sequences and rearranged full-length BCR/TCR V(D)J segments as well as clonotype frequency were also obtained.

Single-cell RNA-seq
Downstream single-cell data analysis of Cell Ranger’s output expression count matrices was performed using the R programming language (version 4.2.1)[2] with the Seurat package (version 4.0).[3]	All samples were integrated into one dataset, categorized according to severity and patient identity. Cell cycle phases were determined for each cell, which were confirmed to have no discernible effect on the variation of the data. Upon evaluation of the quality of the gene counts, the collective sample was restricted to cells associated with more than 500 transcripts, more than 250 genes, and less than 20% mitochondrial genes. Genes with zero counts were also removed from the dataset. After this filtration, 139,987 cells were kept for further analysis. 
The data were normalized, and variable features determined for clustering the cells. The Azimuth web application was used for cluster annotation,[3] and UMAP dimensionality reduction was used to view the resulting cell clusters/types. Azimuth annotations were used as cell type identifiers in further analysis.

Immune repertoire analysis
Gene expression data matrices from the scRNA-seq analysis were subset to two groups: T cells (CD3-enriched cells), and B cells. To these were integrated the clonotype filtered contig data for each library in the scRepertoire R package (version 1.7.0)[4] using the CombineTCR and CombineBCR functions. Only productive TCR/BCR sequences were kept for subsequent analysis. TCR/BCR repertoire analysis was performed using the Seurat and scRepertoire packages in R. 

Statistical analysis
The Shannon index was used to calculate the V gene usage and Ig isotype diversity scores for the individual samples[5], and Wilcoxon’s test was used to compare the clonal and isotype diversity indices between samples, to compare isotype proportions, and to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different subsets of the data.[6] In all statistical comparisons, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the R programming language.[2]

Results
Single-cell RNA-seq
Thirty cell clusters were identified by the Azimuth application across 139,987 cells. Of these, 30,071 (21.5%) were from the samples of the healthy donors, 15,493 (11.1%) were from the COVID-19 patients’ samples in mild stage, 32,182 (23%) in moderate stage, 10518 (7.5%) in severe stage, and 51,723 (36.9%) in critical stage (Figure 1).
Upon examining the proportions of the different cell types among the severity groups, some interesting patterns emerged. CD4TCM ??? , but CD8 TEM cell numbers were inversely proportional to severity in all cases except Patient 2, but plasmablast numbers were in direct proportion to severity except in Patient 5. In Patient 4, a sharp increase in CD4 TCM and plasmablasts was observed with increased severity, accompanied by a decrease in CD8 TEM. Patient 6, who improved over the course of sample collection (from critical to severe to moderate), had a decrease in CD4 TCM, and an increase in CD8 TEM. Of note, in Patient 5, CD4 TCM cells and plasmablasts witnessed a sharp decrease between critical and severe states, but had an increase upon progressing into the moderate state.

BCR
After V(D)J sequence integration into the scRNA-seq data, we obtained 6955 cells classified as B cells: B intermediate (21.6%), B naïve (35.5%), B memory (9.6%), and Plasmablasts (33.3%).
	Our data show that BCR V gene usage diversity was significantly higher in healthy controls than in COVID-19 patients (p value = 0.0029). This is in line with expectation and previous literature.[7] Comparing COVID-19 patients with different outcomes, however, no significant differences in V gene diversity were discerned between deceased and recovered patients. Contrary to expectation and previous reports[8], The proportion of expanded clones (3 cells or more) was significantly higher in critical/severe cases than in mild/moderate ones (p =0.008).
The most abundant V–J gene usage combination was IGHV3-23–IGHJ4, which was observed in all samples regardless of disease status and severity, and has been reported in other COVID-19 studies as well.[7, 9, 10] IGHV3-23 has also been found to be associated with aggressive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) where it is highly mutated,[11] indicating bad prognosis.[12]  The second highest frequency was with IGHV4-34–IGHJ5, mostly detected in the deceased Patient 2’s critical sample (Figure 2), has also been previously observed in COVID-19 patients.[10, 14] 
IGHV3-33, predicted to play a role in the activation of the immune response, as well as in phagocytosis, was the third most common V gene, in combination with IGHJ4. Other studies also identified an increase in this gene in association with COVID-19.[7, 14, 15]  It is also noteworthy that IGHV3-33 has been detected in potent antibodies in the recipients of malaria vaccination. [16]
Of particular interest was the IGH1-18 gene, observed most commonly with IGHJ3 in the deceased Patient 1 in the critical (and terminal) stage. 
Also of interest was IGHV4-39, most highly used in Patient 3’s (deceased) critical sample. This gene has also been used for CLL prognostication, and progression into Richter Syndrome.[13]

J gene usage analysis revealed preferential usage of the IGHJ4 gene for all samples, except for Patient 2, whose critical sample showed a predominance of IGHJ5 usage. No significant difference was observed in J gene usage diversity across the samples.
Upon stimulation, B cells switch from naïve B cells with IgM or IgD antibodies/receptors to (eventually) antibody-producing plasma cells secreting IgA, IgG, or IgE. Whereas a BCR’s affinity for an antigen is improved through somatic hypermutation in the variable region (mostly in the V and J genes), this process of changing Ig type, termed class switching, is achieved through recombination in the heavy-chain constant region, and improves a receptor’s effector functions.[17, 18]
Concerning isotype diversity, we observed more diverse isotypes in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p = 0.0059), which is the opposite direction to V gene usage diversity. No significant difference in isotype diversity was found between deceased and recovered patients. In our collective data set, the most common isotype was IgM; it was also the most common Ig type in the individual samples except those of Patient 2 and Patient 3—both deceased. Patient 2 had larger proportions of IgA1, IgA2, and IgG1; and Patient 3 had IgA1 in the largest proportions. The use of IgA1 was significantly higher in the deceased than in the recovered patients (p = 0.0013) and healthy controls (p = 0.024).


Differential Gene Expression
Based on the IGHV gene biases observed in our samples, we subset the data and sought differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways to find possible associations between certain immune repertoires and transcriptomic profiles for the different samples.

Discussion
It has been suggested that Covid-19 patients exhibit distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection with varying severities.[8] In this study, we sought to better understand differences in the immune response among different severity groups, as well as patients with different outcomes. 
In B cell repertoire analysis, special emphasis was given to the most common heavy-chain Immunoglobulin Heavy Variable (IGHV) genes, especially in combination with J genes; as these are thought to drive the most variation in B cell receptors.[19] IGHV4-34, the second most commonly used V gene, mostly in one of our deceased patients, is associated with self-reactive antibodies.[20] Interestingly, Galson et al.[14] reported the usage of this V gene to be significantly higher in B cells with the IgG1 isotype in improving COVID-19 patients than those in stable or deteriorating patients, while in our data set, IGHV-34 associated with IgG1 was mostly detected in one of the deteriorating (and eventually deceased) patients.
IGHV1-18–IGHJ3 was the most common gene segment combination in Patient 1’s critical sample. It has been reported that use of this gene is elevated in acute dengue “without warning signs”[21], and has been identified as first in a panel of biomarkers for predicting complete remission to treatment in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis.[22] IGHV1-18 is also associated with tumor immunity, and others have detected it as a positive prognostic marker gene in immune cells in the melanoma tumor microenvironment.[23, 24]
